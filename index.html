<p>The publication of this document by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="abced">W3C</a> as a W3C Working Draft does not imply that all of the participants in the W3C HTML working group endorse the contents of the specification. Indeed, for any section of the specification, one can usually find many members of the working group or of the W3C as a whole who object strongly to the current text, the existence of the section at all, or the idea that the working group should even spend time discussing the concept of that section.
